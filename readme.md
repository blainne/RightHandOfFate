This is a very simple christmas lottery application. The lottery is a tradition in my family where everyone randomly picks another person from the pool to buy a christmas gift to them.

The code is written with several goals in mind:

* To practice the approach presented by Mark Seemann in his ["Decoupling decisions from effects"](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2016/09/26/decoupling-decisions-from-effects/) post.
* To write a complete end-to-end web application with REST api and a database in F# (without a GUI, at least for now)
* To get familiar with modern F# tooling like FAKE, Paket, etc.
